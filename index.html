<!--
  HTML FOUNDATION FILE - The Basic Structure of the Webpage
  
  This is the foundation of our entire application. Think of it like the frame of a house.
  It creates the basic structure that everything else gets built on top of.
  
  What this file does:
  - Tells the browser "this is an HTML webpage"
  - Sets up the page title (what appears in the browser tab)
  - Creates an empty container (div with id="root") where our React app will appear
  - Links to our main JavaScript file (main.jsx) which starts the app
-->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Character encoding - tells the browser how to interpret text characters -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- Viewport settings - makes the page work well on mobile devices -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- Page title - appears in the browser tab -->
    <title>MTG App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This empty div is where our entire React application will appear -->
    <!-- Think of it as an empty picture frame waiting for a painting -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- This links to our main.jsx file, which starts the React application -->
    <script type="module" src="/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
